# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- An AI coding CLI — [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Gemini CLI, Codex, Qwen Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity CLI, or Grok Build CLI (see [Supported CLIs](SUPPORTED_CLIS.md))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22.5+ and `git`
- (Optional) Go 1.21+ (for the dashboard TUI)

## Quick Start

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaijindev/career-ops-japan.git
cd career-ops-japan
npm install
```

Then open your selected AI CLI in the workspace, for example `codex`, `claude`,
or `opencode`.

On first launch, the selected CLI can guide conversational setup for your CV,
profile, and target roles. You can also edit the documented local configuration
files yourself. Then paste a job URL or description for evaluation.

If you are using Codex, start the interactive session with `codex`. Slash commands are not guaranteed in Codex, so use the same mode names in a prompt if `/career-ops` is unavailable:

```text
Evaluate this JD with career-ops auto-pipeline: https://company.com/jobs/123
Run the career-ops scan mode.
Run the career-ops pipeline mode.
Run the career-ops pdf mode.
Run the career-ops email mode for the latest evaluated role. Draft only; never sends, submits, or clicks.
Run the career-ops tracker mode.
```

For one-shot workers or batch tasks in Codex, use `codex exec`. See [docs/CODEX.md](CODEX.md) for the full guide.

```bash
codex exec "Evaluate this JD with career-ops auto-pipeline: https://company.com/jobs/123"
codex exec "Run career-ops scan mode in this repo."
codex exec "Run career-ops pipeline mode for data/pipeline.md."
codex exec "Run career-ops pdf mode for the latest evaluated role."
codex exec "Run career-ops email mode for the latest evaluated role. Draft only; do not send, submit, or click anything."
codex exec "Run career-ops tracker mode and summarize the current statuses."
```

### Upstream reference

<details>
<summary>Why the upstream setup guide is retained</summary>

The broader upstream repository retains additional CLI integrations and
standalone evaluators. Those instructions are not the supported installation
path for this Japan checkout; use the clone-and-install steps above.

### PDF rendering

`npm install` runs the repository's Playwright browser install hook. If your
environment skips lifecycle scripts, install Chromium explicitly:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Available Commands

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Evaluate an offer | Paste a URL or JD text |

```bash
node cv-sync-check.mjs      # Check configuration
node verify-pipeline.mjs     # Check pipeline integrity
```

## Build Dashboard (Optional)

```bash
npm run serve:dashboard     # Opens TUI pipeline viewer
npm run build:dashboard     # Optional: build the standalone binary
```
